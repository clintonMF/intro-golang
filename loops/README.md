# README for Loops folder

- this is the readme for the loops folder
- the **fd.go** and **for_loop.go** files follow the original roadmap.
- It is advised you go through the **functions.go** file and ***data structures*** folder before going through the **range.go** file.
- Doing the above would ensure that you properly understand the codes in the file if you are new to golang.
